Introduction
------------
Terminologies API that serves the mapping.

Installation
------------
### Requirements
To deploy it docker must be installed.

### Local deployment
For deploying it localy first you must build the docker image

```bash
docker build . -t terminologies
```
Once this is done, for runing the API on port 3000 run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name terminologies terminologies
```
This command will respond with the port that its being used to run. In this example [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


### Kubernetes deployment

For deploying the terminology module on kubernetes first apply the [001_terminology-deployment.yaml](https://github.com/Gravitate-Health/terminology/blob/main/YAMLs/001_terminology-deployment.yaml)

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./YAML/001_terminology-deployment.yaml
```
Once the deployment is running, apply the service [002_terminology-svc.yaml](https://github.com/Gravitate-Health/terminology/blob/main/YAMLs/002_terminology-svc.yaml)

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./YAML/002_terminology-svc.yaml
```
Finally apply the virtual service [003_terminology-vs.yaml](https://github.com/Gravitate-Health/terminology/blob/main/YAMLs/003_terminology-vs.yaml)

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./YAML/003_terminology-vs.yaml
```
